# Lab 2 - Basic Circuits

# By: Noah Lane & Lily Schlaug
# Summary
Lab goal, summary of work performed, & summary of outcome: 

Lab 2's focus is to develop a better understanding of the three major laws of basic circuit analysis: Kirchhoff's voltage Law, Kirchhoff's current law and Thevenin's theorem. Lab 2 began with an introduction to proper soldering and circuit building techniques by making and soldering a series circuit onto a solder breadboard and then measuring the voltage drop across each of the components in the circuit. After summing the voltage drops across the resistors the value was equivalent to that of the voltage supplied by the DC power supply. For the second part of the lab, two circuits were constructed on a solderless breadboard that consisted of five resistors with three in series and two in parallel for Part 2.1 and four resistors, three in series and one in parallel, for Part 2.2 and 2.3. **Outcome of measured vs calculated data for 2.1,2.2,2.3.**

# Test Results

Below is the table of labeled resistor values compared to the measured resistor value that was taken at the time of the lab. 

**Part 1 - Series Circuit**
| Labeled resistor value(kΩ) | Measured resistor value(kΩ) |
| ---------------------------| ----------------------------|
| R1(1)  | 0.981  |
| R2(2.2)  | 2.169  |
| R3(5.1)  | 5.013 |
|Sum|8.18|

Below is the measured voltage drop across each of the resistors. 

| Resistor   | Voltage Drop (V) |
| -----------| -----------------|
| R1| 1.203  |
| R2  | 2.66  |
| R3  | 6.142 |
|Sum|10.005|

**Part 2.1**

Below is the verification that the DCPS provided the same measured voltage as it displayed.  

| Displayed Power (V) | Measured Power (V) |
| --------------------| -------------------|
|12|12|

Below is the measured resistor value that was taken of each resistor at the time of building the circuit. 

| Labeled resistor value(kΩ) | Measured resistor value(kΩ) |
| ---------------------------| ----------------------------|
| R1(4.7)  | 4.6  |
| R2(6.8)  | 6.79  |
| R3(15)  | 14.74 |
| R4(220)  | 219.3  |
| R5(2.2)  | 2.188  |

Below is the voltage drop across Rl/R5 and the current through Rl/R5. 

| Resistor | Voltage drop (V) | Current(mA) |
| ---------| ----------------|---------|
|R5|3.57|1.66|

Below is a comparison of the measured current and calculated current after removing R5 from the circuit. It is likely that a mistake was made in the calculated currents due to the vast difference from the measured. 

| Current   | Measured Current (mA)| Calculated Currents (mA)|
| ----------| ---------------------|-------------------------|
| I1(R1)| 0.51  | 2.5 |
| I2(R2)  | 0.46  | 0.23 |
| I3(R4)  | 0.06 | 2.27 |

**Part 2.2**

Below is the measured magnitude and calculated values of voltage drop across resistors R1, R2, R3, & R4. At this point, R5 is still removed from the circuit. It is likely that a mistake was made in the calculated voltage due to the vast difference from the measured. 

| Voltage | Measured Magnitude (V) | Calculated Voltage (V)|
| --------| -----------------------|-----------------------|
| V1| 2.286  | 2.4 |
| V2  | 3.064  | 3.13|
| V3  | 6.65 | 0.9 |
|V4,V5|9.72| 4.7 |

| Rth  | 2.66  |
| I n | 6.142 |
|Vl| 10.005 |
|Il| 3.76 |

# Conclusion 

This lab focused on measuring current, voltage and resistance in a variety of circuit arrangements. This allowed us to see how circuits change based on the arrangement of elements. Practicing using the DMM to measure values provided a comparison to the values that are able to be calculated with Ohm's Law. Finally, the circuit was analyzed based on Thevenin circuit analysis principles. 

# Discussion

Did you make any design decisions that had an impact on the results? How did they impact the results? What do the results mean?

Discussion Question 1: How much power does each resistor dissipate? Each branch? Total power? Is the power in equal to the power out? 

Based on the equation Power=Current*Voltage, the amount of power can be calculated for a number of scenarios. The power each resistor dissipates is as follows (units are in mW): P1= 1.17, P2= 1.41, P3= 1.9 and P4= 0.399. Each branch dissipates the sum of the power dissipated in each resistor. So, P1=1.17, P2= 3.31, and P3=0.399. Summing all the values, the total power is 4.88. So, the power in is greater than the power out. 

Discussion Question 2: Does ITH = IL? 

Yes, according Thevenin's Theorem, these values should be equal to one another. If both of these values were measured and calculated correctly, they should equal one another.
